Water Quality Analysis Dashboard
The Water Quality Analysis Dashboard is an interactive web application developed using Streamlit. It provides real-time visual insights into key water quality parameters such as pH, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), and Temperature across different monitoring stations. Users can filter data by date and station to explore environmental trends. The dashboard features line and pie charts for easy data interpretation and is designed with a clean, user-friendly interface.

This is a simple and interactive dashboard built using Python and Streamlit to analyze and visualize water quality data. It helps users understand water conditions such as pH, BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand), and Temperature across different stations over time.

What This Dashboard Does
Shows line charts for trends in pH, BOD, and temperature
Uses pie charts to show the distribution of water quality data by station
Allows users to filter data by date and station name
Helps monitor changes in water quality over time
Tools Used
Python (Data analysis)
Pandas (Data handling)
Plotly (Interactive graphs)
Streamlit (Dashboard interface)
Dataset Overview
The dataset used includes the following columns:

date â€“ Date of measurement
station â€“ Name of water station
ph â€“ pH level
bod â€“ Biological Oxygen Demand
temperature â€“ Water temperature
"This is a time series-based water quality dashboard built with Streamlit to analyze and visualize changes in pH, BOD, and Temperature over time."
It involves data collected over time (the date column).

It shows how water quality parameters like pH, BOD, and Temperature change over time.

You use line charts, which are typical for visualizing time series trends.

Project Outcome:
Successfully developed an interactive time series dashboard using Streamlit to monitor water quality.

Enabled visual exploration of pH, BOD, and Temperature trends across multiple stations over time.

Provided real-time filtering and intuitive visualizations (line and pie charts) for better understanding of environmental data.

Demonstrated practical use of Python, data analysis, and visualization tools in a real-world scenario.

Improved data interpretation for decision-making related to water pollution control and quality management.
